I am a **5th-year Ph.D. candidate** in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering at POSTECH](https://ecse.postech.ac.kr/), working in the [Computer Vision Lab](https://cvlab.postech.ac.kr) under the supervision of [Prof. Suha Kwak](https://suhakwak.github.io/). My research focuses on advancing **data-efficient methods** in computer vision and deep learning, particularly in areas such as **multi-modal knowledge distillation, semi- and self-supervised learning,** and their practical applications.  

My work aims to **push the boundaries** of what is possible with limited data, enabling more **scalable and accessible** solutions in computer vision. I am passionate about bridging the gap between **cutting-edge research and real-world impact** through these techniques. If you're interested in my research projects or potential collaborations, I'd be happy to connectâ€”**feel free to reach out!**
