I am currently a 4th year Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering at POSTECH](https://ecse.postech.ac.kr/), where I work in the [Computer Vision Lab](https://cvlab.postech.ac.kr) under the supervision of Prof. [Suha Kwak](https://suhakwak.github.io/). My research focuses on advancing data-efficient methods in computer vision and deep learning. Specifically, I explore areas such as multi-modal knowledge distillation, semi- and self-supervised learning, and their practical applications. 

My work aims to push the boundaries of what can be achieved with limited data, enabling more scalable and accessible solutions in computer vision. I am passionate about leveraging these techniques to bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world impact. If you're interested in my research projects or potential collaborations, I'd be delighted to connect. Feel free to reach outâ€”I'd love to hear from you!
